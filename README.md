Enhancing Retail Sales Predictions with Time Series Techniques
Overview
This project focuses on forecasting daily retail sales using advanced time series and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide actionable insights to optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business planning.

Project Objectives
1. Analyze daily sales trends to understand patterns and seasonality.
2. Apply classical time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA) and machine learning models (LightGBM) for accurate sales prediction.
3. Compare model performance to identify the most effective forecasting approach.

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
  a. Aggregated and cleaned daily sales data.
  b. Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.

2. Modeling Techniques
  a. ARIMA: Captured trends and seasonality in historical sales data.
  b. SARIMA: Incorporated both seasonal and non-seasonal components for improved forecasting.
  c. LightGBM: Leveraged gradient boosting on time-lagged features for enhanced prediction accuracy.

3. Evaluation Metrics
  a. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  b. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  c. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

Results
Model       	RMSE    	MAE	         MAPE (%)
ARIMA	   152,523.21	  126,654.52	    14.99
SARIMA	 227,081.28	  192,265.51	    22.49
LightGBM	73,680.78	   60,628.13     	6.92

Key Insight: LightGBM outperformed ARIMA and SARIMA models, achieving the lowest MAPE of 6.92%, demonstrating superior forecast precision.

Tools & Libraries
1. Python
2. pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
3. statsmodels (for ARIMA & SARIMA)
4. LightGBM
5. scikit-learn

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how combining classical time series techniques with machine learning models can significantly improve retail sales predictions. Businesses can leverage these insights for smarter inventory control and demand planning.
